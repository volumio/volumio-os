# Shellcheck configuration for Volumio OS build system
#
# This build system includes initramfs scripts that run in a different
# context than where shellcheck analyzes them. At boot time:
# - /scripts/functions exists (provided by initramfs-tools)
# - /scripts/volumio-functions exists (copied during build)
# - Variables like rootmnt, BOOT, etc. are set by initramfs infrastructure

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# Reason: initramfs sources files dynamically
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced file (file not found)
# Reason: /scripts/* paths exist at boot, not in repo
disable=SC1091

# SC2154: Variable referenced but not assigned
# Reason: initramfs infrastructure sets rootmnt, BOOT, ROOT, etc.
disable=SC2154

# SC2295: Expansions inside ${..} need to be quoted separately
# Reason: Build system variables (SRC, etc.) are controlled paths
# without glob characters - pattern matching is not a concern
disable=SC2295
